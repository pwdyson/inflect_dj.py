v0.2.0 (2010-08-06)

* major change. rename decorator from pl to verbose_name_plural.
* use version 0.2.0 of inflect so inflect method is plural() not pl()



v0.1.2 (2010-07-11)

* major change. Code reduced to nearly one line as _meta.verbose_name
always contains the name to be pluralised. Much, much simpler now.

v0.1.1 (2010-07-11)

* major change. decorate the model not the Meta. Otherwise can't get
the model name when verbose_name not supplied!

v0.1.0a (2010-07-10)

set up had a dependency on inflect, which is not necessarily on the
system when being installed. Fixed this to go from v0.1.0 to v0.1.0a
